#Required applications:
Composer
# #
Bower (and NodeJS)
# #
# Preparation: #
Like most of the frameworks, we are using the ./public folder as root. You need to set that in your Apache config.
# #
Install dependecies in the root folder with the following command: composer install
# #
After that, install some JS frameworks with: bower install
